## General Idea

We will introduce the basic vector GIS concepts and operations. In particular, we will discuss: spatial join, intersection, union, among others.

## Readings

Despite other papers will be presented, we will replicate together the following paper:

- [Stelios Michalopoulos and Elias Papaioannou, (2013). National Institutions and Subnational Development in Africa. The Quarterly Journal of Economics (2014) 129 (1): 151-213. doi: 10.1093/qje/qjt029](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/1/151.full)

Please, have a look on the GIS strategy followed by the authors.
