## General Idea

We will continue with the basic vector GIS concepts and operations. In this section, we will discuss: buffers and distances. We will put special attention to the application to these techniques to the spatial regression design.

## Readings

Despite other papers will be presented, we will replicate together the following paper:

- [Nathan Nunn (2008). The Long-term Effects of Africa's Slave TradesThe Quarterly Journal of Economics (2008) 123 (1): 139-176. ](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/139.short)<!-- .element target="_blank" -->


Please, have a look on the GIS strategy followed by the authors.
