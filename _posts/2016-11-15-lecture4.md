## General Idea

We will introduce the main concepts on remote sensing data and other concepts related with raster data in GIS analysis. We will put special attention to the application to these techniques to the current academics.

## Readings

Despite other papers will be presented, we will replicate together the following paper:

- [Nathan Nunn (2008). The Long-term Effects of Africa's Slave TradesThe Quarterly Journal of Economics (2008) 123 (1): 139-176. ](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/139.short)<!-- .element target="_blank" -->

Please, have a look on the GIS strategy followed by the authors.
